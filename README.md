# C++ Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains examples of various design patterns implemented in C++. 

Each design pattern is demonstrated with a simple and clear example.

If you take a look into the ```main.cpp``` you will find functions with each POC (They are commented).

If you want to see one in action, you will need to uncomment the desired one to see it in action.

The folder structure should be clear enough, where you can find the code of each example.
